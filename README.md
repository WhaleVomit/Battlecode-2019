# Todo
- sometimes castles aren't producing in later rounds (even with enough karbonite)
- ensure that enemy signals can't get confused with ours
- ensure that signaling robots who are outside of vision range but inside getVisibleRobots() can't mess up the code
- sometimes some prophets are not staying still when patrolling
- better defend from early game mage rush (try making mages defend instead of attack?)
- build more workers for better early game economy
- cap workers when not enough free resources
- keep workers from wasting fuel by alternating between trying to go to resources and running from enemy
- macro attack formation (line instead of clump)
