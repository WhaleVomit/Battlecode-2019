# Todo
- sometimes castles aren't producing in later rounds (even with enough karbonite)
- ensure that enemy signals can't get confused with ours
- ensure that signaling robots who are outside of vision range but inside getVisibleRobots() can't mess up the code
- sometimes some prophets are not staying still when patrolling
- macro attack formation (line instead of clump)
- rangers not attacking?? https://battlecode.org/replays/c54vw2xfpm.bc19
